# Dataset
## From the awesome-datascience Github, I chose to look at datasets listed on data.gov and ultimately chose the Daily Global 5km Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly dataset (https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php) 
## This dataset contains sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (difference from normal) for global sea surface termperatures.
## This dataset can be used to monitor global SST trends and identify threats to temperature-sensative marine life (like corals). It can also be used to identify major marine heatwave events and track the developemnt of El Nino. 

# Book
## I chose <ins>A Course in Machine Learning</ins> by Hal Daum√© III (http://ciml.info/) from the free-datascience-book Github.
## This book provides an introduction to machine learning through 19 chapters. 
## I am interested in this book because I am looking to use Machine Learning to detect and classify different kelp microscopic stages taken from images as part of my research, and though I have a basic understanding of machine learning I would like to learn more.
